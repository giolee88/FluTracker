# Team FluTracker Project 1
This project is also deployed at: https://bogordon86.github.io/FluTracker/

This document contains the Summary and Key Planning notes for Team FluTraker Project 1.
Team Members: 
* Ben Gordon
* Joe Lee
* Lee Hughes

## Project Milestones

*  Initial Data Source Research Internal Review:   12/18 Monday
*  Data Retrievel Finalized.  Cleansing Review:   12/23 Saturday
*  Visualization Renderings. Findings Review:  1/3 Wednesday
*  Presentation Contributions Due: 1/6 Saturday
*  Presentation Due:  1/8 Monday

## Project Proposal
Objective: Investigate historical Per-Capita Flu Outbreaks against the following possible datasets/drivers:
* Weather influencers
* Travel - Air
* Travel - Highway
* Vaccination History

## Finding Data
The team will bring data into the code folder.  CSV files, if required will be stored in code/data.  
Separate python files can contain exploration of each dataset.  The team will review each others findings through by reviewing the code.  
* Flu Incidents (Joe)
* Population (Lee) 
* Weather (Ben)
* Highway Travel (Joe)
* Air Travel (Lee) 
* Vaccination (Ben)

## Summary of Analysis

* Weather highly correlated to influenza incidents
* Vaccinations in 2015 seemed to be more effective than that of 2016
* Air travel during times of influenza spikes show that passenger inflow/outflow counts are close to even.
