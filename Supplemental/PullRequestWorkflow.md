# Pull Request Workflow

When working with **Pull Requests**, consider the following workflow.

## Review & Merge

* First, create a repository, and add any collaborators via the settings panel.

* On your local machines, create and work on local branches.

* When you're satisfied with the changes you've made to your local branch and want to merge it into `master`, **push the branch to GitHub**.

  * I.e., run: `git push origin <branch_name>`

* Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser, and select your branch from the drop-down on the home page.

* Fill out the form that pops up, and press **Create Pull Request**.

* Be sure to discuss **who is responsible for reviewing PRs, and when**.
